# NutJS Windows Control

A Windows control server built using [nut.js](https://nutjs.dev/) and Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing programmatic control over Windows system operations including mouse, keyboard, window management, and screen capture functionality.

> **Note**: While this project may work on Linux and macOS, it has only been tested on Windows. Community feedback on cross-platform compatibility is welcome.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**THIS SOFTWARE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS**

By using this software, you acknowledge and accept that:

- Giving AI models direct control over your computer through this tool is inherently risky
- This software can control your mouse, keyboard, and other system functions which could potentially cause unintended consequences
- You are using this software entirely at your own risk
- The creators and contributors of this project accept NO responsibility for any damage, data loss, or other consequences that may arise from using this software
- This tool should only be used in controlled environments with appropriate safety measures in place

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cheffromspace/nutjs-windows-control.git
cd nutjs-windows-control
```

2. Build libnut-core from source (required if you don't have a paid NutJS license):
```bash
# Install cmake-js globally (required for building)
npm install -g cmake-js

# Clone libnut repository in a parallel directory
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/nut-tree/libnut.git libnut-core
cd libnut-core

# Install dependencies and build
npm install
cmake-js rebuild

# Return to the main project
cd ../nutjs-windows-control
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
npm start
```

For development with auto-recompilation:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Watch mode for development:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Generate coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## MCP Server Configuration

To use this project with Claude, add the following configuration to your MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-control": {
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe",
      "args": [
        "[INSTALL LOCATION]\\nutjs-windows-control\\build\\index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

After configuring your MCP server, restart Claude to see the windows-control service in the menu.

## Project Structure

- `/src`
  - `/handlers` - Request handlers and tool management
  - `/tools` - Core functionality implementations
  - `/types` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `index.ts` - Main application entry point

## Dependencies

- [@modelcontextprotocol/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk) - MCP SDK for protocol implementation
- [@nut-tree/libnut](https://github.com/nut-tree/libnut) - Core native UI automation library
- [clipboardy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clipboardy) - Cross-platform clipboard handling
- [express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web server framework
- [jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) & [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) - Image processing

## Testing

The project currently includes unit tests for core functionality. The following test areas are planned for future development:
- Integration tests for cross-module functionality
- Performance testing
- Error handling validation

## Known Limitations

- Window minimize/restore operations are currently unsupported in libnut-core
- Advanced screen information (multiple monitors, DPI settings) is limited to main display
- Some operations may require elevated permissions depending on the target application
- Cross-platform support (Linux/macOS) is untested
